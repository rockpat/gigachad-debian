# A truely GIGACHAD Setup-Script for Debian (Stable & Testing)

## Prerequisites:
- A minimal (server) like install of Debian (Testing/Trixie ideally), on the BTRFS filessystem. 
- Internet (if you didn't downloaded it before)
- You like KDE ;-)

## What the fuck does it do?
- Setups Debian for a stable & up to date desktop Use (That's why I recommend Testing)
- You have the option to install my dotfiles. (You can ajust the script to grab yours) *
- Breakage protection, thanks to BTRFS, Timeshift & Grub-btrfs *

*=Coming soon

## What is the Purpose of this?
This is a VERY niche setup script that I manly will use but if your taste is simulare to mine, then you will probably like it aswell.
Even though now LinUtil exist, go check it out if you don't know it already, this thing has the purpose of you setting up Debian (Testing) for the Desktop, just like all the Arch Post-Postinstall but better & for Debian.
